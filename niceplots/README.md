#### Instructions

* Simple: `./niceplots.sh <folder to upload with pdfs/pngs>  <output folder name>`
* Example: `./niceplots.sh testplots/ testplotsv1` will upload plots to a page like [this](http://uaf-6.t2.ucsd.edu/~namin/dump/testplotsv1/).

#### Some neat tricks
* If you have a .root or .extra or .txt file with the same name as a plot in your folder, they will get linked on the webpage
* The search supports regex and only becomes case sensitive when a capital letter has been entered
* Copy as url will copy the current search
