doLimits.sh uses the higgs combine tool to produce TH2Fs containing
the significance, limit, and +/- sigma bands for all mass points in
a model scan. The axes of the TH2Fs are the masses in the scan.

This tool must be run after checking out the higgs combine tool, from 
a directory like: CMSSW_7_1_5/src/HiggsAnalysis/CombinedLimit/scripts/
